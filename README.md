## Synopsis

This project is a collection of samples to demonstrate technologies introduced in Magento 2.  You will find the most simple extension along with samples that incrementally add features to lead you through a exploration and education of the Magento 2 platform.

## Motivation

The intent is to learn by example, following our best practices for developing a modular site using Magento 2.

## Installation

Each sample is packaged and available individually at packages.magento.com.  For convenience and demonstration of our bundling of modules, we have included the [sample-bundle-all](sample-bundle-all) composer metapackage.  Including this dependency in your Magento project is the more convenient way to integrate the full set of examples. Refer to that sample for more detailed installation instructions.
